Browgle - A browser-based, multi-user B*ggle game.

SETUP
=====

To run it, you'll need to install http://github.com/miyagawa/Tatsumaki.

    sudo cpan Tatsumaki

is the best way to do that. Then run:

    make all

to get the rest of the dependencies. Finally run:

    ./browgle

from this directory, and your browgle server will be running. Get multiple
people to go to the URL, and have fun!
